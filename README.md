# Notes about Python
here are some notes bout my tufts course, yay!

### If/Else (boolean logic)

Here are some keywords: 

* **if:** check condition (always have one `if`)
* **elif:** check another condition (can have any amount of `elif`)
* **else:** if no conditions are tru (can either have it or not have an `else`)

```python
weather = 78
if weather <= 40:
  print("Bring your jacket, NOW')
elif weather <= 60:
  print("bring a light jacket")
else:
  print("You don't need a jacket")
  

```
